Hockey offside review program.

## Plan
1. Plenty of full NHL games on YouTube
2. Collect screenshots of zone entries and label them as offside or not in a database
3. Feed them into some sort of computer vision software - robovision

## Challenges
1. find the puck
2. find the blue line
3. find players
4. distinguish attacking vs defending players
5. find attacking players trailing skate
6. combine all this to determine if a single frame is offside
